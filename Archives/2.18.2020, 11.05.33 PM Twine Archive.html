Mitch &#39;&#39;flirts&#39;&#39; with Blanche instead of playing the poker game. &#96;[&#96;&quot;You may teach school but you&#39;re certainly not an old maid.&quot; (pp. 56).&#96;]&#96;

//Mitch and Blanche continue to hold their discussion to the dismay of Stanley, who is frustrated Mitch has not returned to the poker game.//

Stanley &#39;&#39;orders&#39;&#39; Mitch to return to the poker game. &#96;[&#96;&quot;Stanley &#96;[&#96;//bellowing//&#96;]&#96;: //Mitch!//&quot; (pp. 56).&#96;]&#96;

Blanche, noticing her sister has returned from the bathroom, decides to put the music back on. &#96;[&#96; &quot;Oh! Have you finished? Wait - I&#39;ll turn on the radio.&quot; (pp. 57).&#96;]&#96;

&quot;Wien, Wien, nur du allein,&quot; begins to pool from the small white radio in the bedroom. Blanche, arms outstretched, begins to waltz with an invisible partner. With a sway, her eyes spill over Mitch, and her hips move suggestively. Welcoming of this fine display, Mitch lights up, more than happy to join Blanche in this slow dance. &#96;[&#96;Blanche &#39;&#39;entertains&#39;&#39; Mitch, hoping to keep him interested. &quot;Blanche waltzes to the music with romantic gestures. Mitch is delighted and moves in awkward imitation like a dancing bear&quot; (pp. 57).&#96;]&#96;

A storm rolling in from the kitchen, Stanley seizes the radio from the nighttable, shouting unforgivable words. The air, thick with silence, is punctuated by a sharp //crash// as the small, white piece of equipment plummets from the bedroom window. It is done. Stanley, with a terrible face heavy with breath, pulls in his outstretched arm. &#96;[&#96;Stanley, frustrated with how the evening has gone, &#39;&#39;interrupts&#39;&#39; the dance between Blanche and Mitch, ending the noise distracting him. &quot;Stanley stalks fiercely through the portieres into the bedroom. He crosses to the small white radio and snatches it off the table. With a shouted oath, he tosses the instrument out the window&quot; (pp. 57).&#96;]&#96;

Blanche is so shocked, she considers what might happen next. If this was a typical night, [[Stella might choose to rush the poker table|Beat 3]]; but Blanche is convinced this won&#39;t end well for anyone.

Blanche thinks that it is worth a shot to try [[soothing|Alt 1]] Stanley, herself. Of course, if that doesn&#39;t work, she can always [[scold|Alt 2]] Stanley in the heat of the moment. If she&#39;s feeling particularly brave, she could outright [[defy|Alt 3]] Stanley&#39;s desire and sing the same song that was playing on the radio; surely, she and Mitch were enjoying it!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Alt 1" tags="" position="499,599" size="100,100">&#39;&#39;Alternative 1&#39;&#39;

Blanche: &quot;Stanley, if that&#39;s how the music made you feel, you must let us know!&quot; &#96;[&#96;//Blanche believes her best chance at diffusing the tension in the room is by &#39;&#39;soothing&#39;&#39; Stanley. Before Stella can even react, Blanche apologizes for her disturbance.//&#96;]&#96;

Blanche: &quot;I&#39;m sorry for pushing it!&quot; &#96;[&#96;//She shoots Mitch a strong glance of concern//.&#96;]&#96; &quot;Mitch, go finish your game. There will be other times for us to talk.&quot; &#96;[&#96;//Mitch nods in contemplative understanding. Stanley, calmer, steps back from the nighttable.//&#96;]&#96;

Stanley &#96;[&#96;//Mumbling//&#96;]&#96;: &quot;I said stop the racket...&quot;

Mitch: &quot;Suppose your right--I&#39;ll finish up.&quot; &#96;[&#96;//Gripping Stanley&#39;s arm.//&#96;]&#96;  &quot;Come, let&#39;s leave Ms. DuBois to it.&quot;

//Blanche gains peace but loses the opportunity to speak to Mitch and no longer has access to the radio by choosing to &#39;&#39;soothe&#39;&#39; Stanley. Now much calmer, Stanley is allowed to finish his poker game. Blanche and Stella turn in for the night. Although everything has been resolved without tension, this doesn&#39;t make for a great, explosive turning point.//

Blanche: &quot;A grown man like you? Acting like a wild dog!&quot;

Stanley: &quot;Stop the racket, woman!&quot; &#96;[&#96;//He raises his arm, prepared to bring the full weight of it down on Blanche&#39;s cheek.//&#96;]&#96;.

Blanche &#96;[&#96;//Frightened, eyes closed//&#96;]&#96;: &quot;Lord, is this how you treat your wife&#39;s sister?&quot;

Stella &#96;[&#96;//Wildly//&#96;]&#96;: &quot;//Stanley! Let her alone!//&quot;

&#96;[&#96;//Stanley hesitates, giving Mitch a chance to grab his arm, stopping it inches from Blanche&#39;s face.//&#96;]&#96;

Mitch: &quot;What&#39;s gotten into you?&quot;

Stella: &quot;It was just a little bit of music...&quot; &#96;[&#96;//Stanley realizes everyone is looking at him. By now, everyone at the poker table has shuffled into the doorway of the bedroom.//&#96;]&#96;

Stella &#96;[&#96;//Sighing//&#96;]&#96;: We&#39;ll have to get a new one.&quot;

Stanley: &quot;Alright, shows over.&quot; &#96;[&#96;//He begins to wave and shoo the other players away.//&#96;]&#96; &quot;Get on home with you. I&#39;m going to bed.&quot;

//Blanche feels good about standing up to Stanley and &#39;&#39;scolding&#39;&#39; him. Stanley does not finish his poker game, balking under the embarassment. Stella, more than ready for this night to come to an end, encourages him to wash his face before bed. Mitch bids Blanche farewell and goodnight and everyone returns to their respective homes, perhaps all a little disappointed in Stanley.//

Blanche &#96;[&#96;//Singing//&#96;]&#96;: &quot;Wien, Wien~&quot;

Stanley: &quot;Do I need to throw you out too!&quot; &#96;[&#96;//He flings out a wild punch towards Blanche that Mitch manages to push off.//&#96;]&#96;.

Blanche &#96;[&#96;//Unflinching//&#96;]&#96;: &quot;~nur du allien~&quot; &#96;[&#96;//Stanley tries to grab Blanche&#39;s arm to pull her out the room, but, Mitch stands his ground between them.//&#96;]&#96;

&#96;[&#96;//Stanley, still angry, punches Mitch square in the nose.//&#96;]&#96;

Mitch &#96;[&#96;//Clutching face//&#96;]&#96;: &quot;You //f**k!//&quot;

Stanley &#96;[&#96;//Slurring//&#96;]&#96;: &quot;Don&#39;t tell me what I can and can&#39;t do in my house.&quot;

&#96;[&#96;//By now, the others have mobilized, moving from the poker table to pin Stanley down to the floor to prevent him from hurting others or himself.//&#96;]&#96;.

Mitch &#96;[&#96;//Nasally//&#96;]&#96;: &quot;Y-you //broke// it. My nose.&quot;

//Blanche, unintimidated by Stanley’s drunken attempt at subjugation, breaks out into song, &#39;&#39;defying&#39;&#39; his wishes. If she couldn’t have the music from the radio, she would still have the music in her heart. Lovely as her voice may be, it does little to stop the drunkard from flying into a fit of rage. Luckily, with Mitch’s quick-thinking, Stanley’s fist is stopped short of harming Blanche, but, it meant he bore the brunt of the attack instead.//

&#39;&#39;[[The End|References]]&#39;&#39;.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Beat 3" tags="" position="907,303" size="100,200">&#39;&#39;Turning Point&#39;&#39;

Blanche, in the end, chooses to do nothing different. The night plays out in a typical, explosive fashion.

Stella, furious with her husband&#39;s wanton destruction, decides to put an end to the night&#39;s action herself. Armed with nothing but her frustrations, she bears toward the poker table, declaring it is time to leave, but not before calling her husband a stinking drunkard. &#96;[&#96;Stella &#39;&#39;rushes&#39;&#39; the poker table to curse Stanley out and kick out his friends. &quot;//Drunk-drunk-animal thing, you!// &#96;[&#96;//She rushes through to the poker table//&#96;]&#96; All of you-please go home! If any of you have one spark of decency in you-&quot; (pp. 57).&#96;]&#96;.

Stanley, drunk and angry, doesn&#39;t like being compared to a stinking animal. Like any feral man who refuses to see his faults, there is no pause to ponder the situation nor ounce of restraint in his action. By the time he reaches Stella, it is too late. Blanche&#39;s warning does not stop his fists and his colleagues are too slow to prevent the inevitable. &#96;[&#96;Blanche &#96;[&#96;//wildly//&#96;]&#96;: Stella, watch out, he&#39;s-- &#96;[&#96;//Stanley charges after Stella//.&#96;]&#96; ... &#96;[&#96;//There is the sound of a blow//&#96;]&#96; (pp. 57).&#96;]&#96;.

But you already knew this was going to happen.

Naseem chuckles and crosses his arms before leaning back in his chair. He puts his two legs up on top of the desk. &quot;You quit?&quot;

Farah nods, and moves to leave the room. She&#39;s hoping that Naseem doesn&#39;t realize the lie. *Of course I&#39;m going to push this*.

It&#39;s a good thing she held onto the documents. Naseem threatened litigation against Farah, claiming that he fired her because she was ultimately behind the accused fraud. This story didn&#39;t pan out in court and the public was ultimately swayed by the expose Farah would help the Chronicle undertake.

After firing Farah, Naseem threatened litigation against Farah. He claimed that he fired her because she was ultimately behind the accused fraud. This story didn&#39;t pan out in court, but Farah&#39;s public image was damaged because the Chronicle was never able to publish an expose. They lacked the damning evidence they needed to.]](else-if: $quit is true)[(if: $documents is &quot;saved&quot; is true)[
It&#39;s a good thing she quit then and there. When Farah returned to clear her desk and leave, she was able to send a couple of emails explaining the situation to a few coworkers. The documents would serve as the crucial piece of evidence needed for the Chronicle to write their expose. Turns out Naseem had empty threats; they would never sell out to a bully. Her emails were enough to get others at the company to confront Naseem and speak out about the issue.

It&#39;s a good thing she quit then and there. When Farah returned to clear her desk and leave, she was able to send a couple of emails explaining the situation to a few coworkers. The Chronicle turned down the story on the grounds that, without enough evidence, their journalistic integrity could be challenged. Luckily her emails were enough to get others at the company to confront Naseem and speak out about the issue.
]](else:)[
By choosing not to speak out and not to leave, Farah became complicit in the double decade-long scandal playing out at the company. Things were quiet, for a while. The auditors came and went as the years went by. Farah spoke little of her time at the company to her family from then on. 

She would much rather spend her new annual bonus on vacations around the country with her children.
